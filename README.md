## What I Do

I combine **data analysis and cybersecurity expertise** to identify vulnerabilities and solve real problems. As a Black woman and neurodivergent professional, I bring an equity lens to technical workâ€”asking not just "does it work?" but "who does this serve?"

My approach: Apply rigorous analysis to security challenges, communicate findings clearly, and focus on solutions that matter.
