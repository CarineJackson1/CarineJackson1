## üéØ What I Do

I bridge **data science, cybersecurity, and AI ethics**‚Äîexploring where systems fail and who gets harmed. By combining security thinking, data analysis, and an equity lens, I identify vulnerabilities that traditional testing misses.

**My approach:** Most AI safety testing comes from security experts thinking like attackers. I test differently‚Äîfrom the perspective of real people with diverse communication styles, backgrounds, and needs. In cybersecurity, I focus on building automated, resilient defenses and understanding threat landscapes through data.

## üî¨ Featured Research

### ‚≠ê **AI Communication Patterns & Security Vulnerabilities**
**Research Project** | *In Progress*

Testing how AI assistants respond to diverse communication styles and identifying security gaps that affect real users.

**Research Questions:**
- How do fragmented/non-linear prompts interact with AI safety mechanisms?
- Which communication patterns (ADHD, autism, anxiety) reveal vulnerabilities?
- Do edge cases from underrepresented users bypass safety guidelines?

**Why It Matters:** Reveals security gaps in AI systems that traditional adversarial testing misses‚Äîespecially those affecting underrepresented communities.

**Methods:** Systematic testing across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot using Python data analysis and statistical measurement.

**Status:** Testing phase ‚Üí Data analysis ‚Üí Publishing findings
