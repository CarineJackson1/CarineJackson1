## 🎯 What I Do

I explore **where AI systems fail—and who gets harmed**. By combining data analysis, security thinking, and an equity lens, I identify vulnerabilities that traditional testing misses.

**My angle:** Most AI safety testing comes from security experts thinking like attackers. I test differently—from the perspective of real people with diverse communication styles, backgrounds, and needs.

## 🔬 Current Research & Projects

### 🚨 **AI Communication Patterns & Security Vulnerabilities** ⭐ FEATURED
**Research Project** | *In Progress*

Testing how AI assistants respond to diverse communication styles and identifying security gaps.

**What I'm investigating:**
- How fragmented/non-linear prompts interact with AI safety mechanisms
- Which communication patterns (ADHD, autism, anxiety) reveal vulnerabilities
- Whether edge cases from underrepresented users bypass safety guidelines

**Methods:**
- Systematic testing across multiple AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Data collection and analysis using Python, pandas, statistical methods
- Vulnerability assessment and reproducibility testing
- Creating visualizations and security findings documentation

**Why it matters:**
Reveals security gaps in AI systems that affect real users—not just theoretical attackers. This research bridges AI ethics, cybersecurity, and accessibility.

**Tech Stack:** Python • Pandas • Data Visualization • Statistical Analysis • Research Methodology

**Status:** Testing phase → Analysis phase → Publishing findings (Timeline: 6-8 weeks)
