## 🎯 What I Do

I bridge **data science, cybersecurity, and AI ethics**—exploring where systems fail and who gets harmed. By combining security thinking, data analysis, and an equity lens, I identify vulnerabilities that traditional testing misses.

**My angle:** Most AI safety testing comes from security experts thinking like attackers. I test differently—from the perspective of real people with diverse communication styles, backgrounds, and needs. In cybersecurity, I focus on building automated, resilient defenses and understanding threat landscapes through data.

## 🔬 Current & Featured Projects

### ⭐ **AI Communication Patterns & Security Vulnerabilities** [FEATURED]
**Research Project** | *In Progress*

Testing how AI assistants respond to diverse communication styles and identifying security gaps that affect real users.

**What I'm investigating:**
- How fragmented/non-linear prompts interact with AI safety mechanisms
- Which communication patterns (ADHD, autism, anxiety) reveal vulnerabilities
- Whether edge cases from underrepresented users bypass safety guidelines

**Why it matters:** Reveals security gaps in AI systems that traditional adversarial testing misses—especially those affecting underrepresented communities.

**Tech Stack:** Python • Pandas • Data Visualization • Statistical Analysis • Research Methodology

**Status:** Testing phase → Analysis phase → Publishing findings
